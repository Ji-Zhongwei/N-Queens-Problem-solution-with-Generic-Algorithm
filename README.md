This is C++ program of N-queens problem using Generic Algorithm.

The parameters which can be adjusted is in the head of "main.cpp", details are as follow:

	// Target string to be generated
	const int N = 100;
	// Number of individuals in each generation
	const int POPULATION_SIZE = min(3 * N, 100);
	// Probability of mutation
	const int MUTATION_PROB = 0.3;

After running, an output file named "output.exe" will be generated, the results will be listed in the file.
